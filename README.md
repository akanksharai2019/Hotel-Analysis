HOTEL ANALYSIS

The dataset consists of 119090 rows and 32 columns.

The objective is to help in the planning of hotel capacity, manage resources, and achieve any synergies that may arise with regards to tourists or other hotel visitors.

Based on the dataset, visitors were from around the globe, with the majority coming from Portugal, the UK, France, Denmark, and Germany. 

Mostly resort hotels were occupied and they were cheaper compared to city hotels. Most cancellations occurred in city hotels, with about 25% being resort cancellations. 

Visitors ranged from groups to individuals who booked their tickets online, and fewer complimentary rooms were given.

This data also helped us understand breakfast preferences, which will enable us to prepare better arrangements.
